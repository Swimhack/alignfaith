# ALIGN — Source of Truth

> **This document is the single source of truth for implementation.**

**Platform name:** Align  
**Domain:** AlignFaith.com

## Overview

Align is a faith-centered relationship platform designed to prioritize alignment of values, life direction, maturity, and intentionality, rather than surface-level similarity.

**Align is not a swipe app.**

It is an intentional matching system built around six core pillars of life.

---

## Core Philosophy

Not all areas of life matter equally in a long-term relationship.

- Some differences are preferences.
- Others are foundational.

Align reflects this reality by weighting pillars based on how deeply they affect worldview, character, and relationship health.

---

## Pillar Priority and Weighting

*(Internal logic, not shown to users)*

| Pillar | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Spiritual Fitness | 30% |
| Mental Fitness | 20% |
| Intimacy Fitness | 20% |
| Financial Fitness | 15% |
| Physical Fitness | 10% |
| Appearance Fitness | 5% |

- Spiritual alignment has the greatest influence.
- Appearance has the least.

---

## Matching Rules (Plain Language)

- One selection per dropdown
- Each selection represents a level from 1 to 5
- **Lower numbers indicate stronger alignment**
- The system compares how far apart two users are within each pillar
- Pillars with higher priority influence matches more strongly
- Certain mismatches act as **hard stops** regardless of other alignment

**Users never see scores or math. They see alignment tiers and summaries.**
